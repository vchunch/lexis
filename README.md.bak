# my-web-app

Here is my proposed  solution for the Used case.

### Step to create a complete infra:

Assuming that you have already stored the AWS credential in the your gitlab .

1) Clone the repo 
2) cd ec_terraform
3) run the command ssh-keygen -f mykey
4) Commit the chnages and push the code 

The CI/CD pipeline will built a complete infra for hosting the web page.
